Project 1

Write a python script to read all files in the data folder and combine them into a single file.
Write the combined file in a folder called Project 1. Then commit and push all the changes to your respective branches.

Project 2

same as Project 1, but rather than appending files I would like you to MERGE them.
you will then explain to me the difference between APPEND and MERGE

Project 3

Make a line plot of each column in the Master file.
This should be presented in a single plot where each column line plot is a subplot.

Project 4

Use the APPLY function to convert a DF column based on the following logic..
if column value is greater than 0 change it to 1000, else make it 0

Project 5

For each CSV file in the Data folder, add a column called Tag Name. The value of this column will be a string. The string will be extracted from the file name, and will be between the LAST DOT and the SECOND LAST DOT.
APPEND all the Dataframes and save as .CSV
Read back the CSV from step 2, and PIVOT the DF on the TAG NAME column. Save the PIOVTED DF as a CSV

Project 7

Using Python extract first 10000 rows of the table in sqllite
For the column with Flow values, calculate the 7 day moving average
Create a new Moving Average column and write the results back to SQLLite

Project 8

Extract the Flow and Moving Day Average Flow from SQLite
Plot the two trends using Plotly
Plot the two trends with Seaborn
Normalize the two columns and plot them on Plotly and Seaborn

Project 9

Take the file from Project 7 and plot it as a LINE PLOT in PLOTLY.
